# THE HYPOCHRIST'S HOMEPAGE REPOSITORY.

### THIS REPO IS FOR MY OWN LEARNING OF GITHUB; **DO NOT CARE** ABOUT IT !

FIRST, IF YOU'RE COMMING FROM BECODE VISIT MY [HOMEPAGE](HTTPS://THE-HYPOCHRIST.GITHUB.IO)

SO, WE CAN ADD SOME STUFF HERE

1. STUFF HERE. I KNOW, IT'S NOT FUNNY (WELL, AS I AM)

2. IN FACT, I'VE NO IDEAS, SO I'M GOING TO MAKE A LIST OF DIFFERENT THINGS THAT CAN BE DONE WITH MARKDOWN.
  - OBVIOUSLY, WE CAN MAKE LISTS, THIS IS AN UNORDERED LIST, AND ABOVE IT'S AN ORDERED LIST.
  - WE CAN ALSO MAKE HEADERS IN MANNY LEVELS (6).
  - BECAUSE IT'S EASIER TO SHOW IT, THAT'S I WILL DO INSTEAD OF SIMPLY TELL IT.



> **TWO** THINGS ARE INFINITE: **UNIVERSE** AND **HUMAN STUPIDITY**; AND I'M NOT SURE ABOUT THE UNIVERSE
