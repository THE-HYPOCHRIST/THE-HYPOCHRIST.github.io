# THE HYPOCHRIST'S HOMEPAGE REPOSITORY.

### THIS REPO IS FOR MY OWN LEARNING OF GITHUB; *DO NOT CARE* ABOUT IT !

FIRST, IF YOU'RE COMMING FROM [BECODE](HTTPS://BECODE.ORG) VISIT MY [HOMEPAGE](HTTPS://THE-HYPOCHRIST.GITHUB.IO)

SO, WE CAN ADD SOME STUFF HERE

1. STUFF HERE. I KNOW, IT'S NOT FUNNY (WELL, AS I AM)

2. IN FACT, I'VE NO IDEAS, SO I'M GOING TO MAKE A LIST OF DIFFERENT THINGS THAT CAN BE DONE WITH MARKDOWN.
  - OBVIOUSLY, WE CAN MAKE LISTS, THIS IS AN UNORDERED LIST, AND ABOVE IT'S AN ORDERED LIST.
  - WE CAN ALSO MAKE HEADERS IN MANNY LEVELS (6).
  - BECAUSE IT'S EASIER TO SHOW IT, THAT'S I WILL DO INSTEAD OF SIMPLY TELL IT.

IF YOU WANT TO ADD SOME CODE INSIDE A MD FILE PROCEED AS BELOW :

```C
include <stdio.h>
include <stdlib.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
  printf("HELLO WORLD");
}
```


> **TWO** THINGS ARE INFINITE: **UNIVERSE** AND **HUMAN STUPIDITY**; AND I'M NOT SURE ABOUT THE UNIVERSE
